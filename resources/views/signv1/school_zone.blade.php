            <h5 class="text-dark pt-4">Ensuring Child Safety in School Zones</h5>
            <p>
                Radar speed signs are an essential tool for improving safety in school zones by encouraging
                drivers to slow down and comply with posted speed limits. With children crossing streets and
                walking near roadways, it is critical to implement measures that effectively manage vehicle
                speeds and protect young pedestrians.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-dark pt-4">How Radar Speed Signs Work</h5>
            <p>
                Radar speed signs detect the speed of approaching vehicles using radar technology. The
                vehicle's speed is displayed in real time, often with visual alerts like flashing lights or
                changing colors to grab the driverâ€™s attention. This immediate feedback prompts drivers to
                reduce speed, especially in areas where children are present.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-dark pt-4">Benefits of Radar Speed Signs in School Zones</h5>
            <ol class="ml-3 p-4">
                <li>
                    <strong> Improved Driver Awareness:</strong>  Real-time feedback alerts drivers to slow down when
                    entering school zones.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enhanced Pedestrian Safety: </strong> Slower speeds reduce the risk of accidents, protecting
                    children and families.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Non-Punitive Compliance:</strong>  Focuses on voluntary speed reduction rather than issuing
                    fines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Custom Messaging Options: </strong>  Display messages such as "School Zone Ahead" or
                    "Slow Down" along with speed data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Traffic Data Collection:</strong>  Provides insights into traffic patterns to help authorities
                    monitor compliance and plan safety improvements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Eco-Friendly and Energy-Efficient: </strong>Solar-powered options make installations cost
                    effective and sustainable.
